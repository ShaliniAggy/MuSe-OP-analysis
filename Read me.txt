Summary of the logic flow:
1.	MuSe output file processing:
•	Identified and extracted the search query and paragraphs from the MuSe output file. Query genes were the selected 3000 LncRNA genes.
•	Empty search results were removed. 
•	Unique Sentences Generation: For each query gene, mapped paragraphs were reduced to five words length starting from the five action keywords i.e. suppresses, interacts, activates, stimulates, and binds.
2.	Gene Information Extraction from GC Suite:
•	Gene CSV generation: For each Gene symbol in the GC Suite aliases, category, class and description were extracted in CSV format.
4.	Gene Database Integration:
•	Unique Sentences were screened for gene symbols and mapped against Gene CSV file for information about the gene symbol, category, and class. 
5.	Data Cleanup and Filtering:
•	The merged information was filtered and sorted to remove irrelevant information.
6.	Exporting Results:
•	The final dataframe, containing relevant gene information and sentences, was exported to a CSV file
